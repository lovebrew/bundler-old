## --- Build Options --- ##

# [bool]   @clean         : Clean the build artifacts and directory before a new build.
#                           This helps reduce chances of cluttering the built data.
#                           Default: false.
#
# [array]  @targts        : Target console(s) to build for. Default: ["3ds", "switch"].
#
# [string] @source        : Game source directory; relative to the config
#                           file. Default: "game".
#
# [string] @icon          : Icon name. Do not provide the extension.
#                           lovebrew will automatically provide this.
#                           It can include a prepended path. This is relative
#                           to the config file. Default: "icon".

## --- Output Options --- ##

# [string] @build   : Output directory for compilation; relative to the config
#                     file. When false, it will use current directory.

#
# [bool]   @rawData : Whether or not to properly build a 3DS project binary.
#                     This will not build a 3DS application. See @build.targets.
#                     When false, outputs as a 3dsx; when true, output only
#                     as the "raw" game folder used for testing purposes.
#                     Default: false.
#
# [string] @romFS   : The directory within the build directory which gets
#                     zipped and appended to the resulting binary. Default: "game".
#                     NOTE: if "rawData" is true, this does not get zipped and can
#                     be used for quick testing. However, the directory must be named
#                     as the default, "game".
